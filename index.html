              With conflicts emerging in different corners of the world, 
              reporters brave enough to fight the power are forced to abandon their motherland and live in exile. 
              Their stories not only represent the setback for their countries but also for journalism and democracy.

            As Kabul collapsed on August 15, 2021, so did Lina Shirzad’s 
            dreams and goals for her motherland. In the end, she had no option 
            but to start afresh at 27, a life circumstantially chosen for her, in exile. 
            “I did not think that one day Afghanistan would fall, and all my dreams would just remain a dream,” said Shirzad.

            Once the USA announced the withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan, 
            the Taliban launched a paramount offensive, taking over several provincial capitals of the country. 
            To escape their extremist methods, citizens started fleeing to Kabul, the nation’s capital, 
            hoping to find protection from the Islamic fundamentalist group. To their dismay, the Taliban eventually entered Kabul,
            crumbling Afghan security forces and took control of the presidential palace. 
          </p>
          <p class="section-text">
            Soldiers abandoned their posts, some surrendered to the Taliban, and the Afghan government collapsed. 
            The 20-year US-led military campaign in Afghanistan officially came to an end. The United States ended its 
            longest war of bloodshed. For Afghanistan, after more than one year of Taliban rule, the country still lives in fear and uncertainty.

            Lina Shirzad is one of many journalists who had to flee their country if they wanted a shot at living a decent life, 
            or in some cases, having a life at all. For Shirzad, this decision came at the cost of separating from everyone 
            she loves.

            “The moment when I was leaving Afghanistan was very difficult. I shed so many tears that even after all these months,
             I have not recovered because I left home alone and no one from my family was with me,” she added.

          <p class="section-text">
            Shirzad had been working as a journalist in northern Afghanistan for 13 years. She grew up in Badakhshan and was 
            working in the same province. When her hometown fell, she fled to Kabul and stayed at Afghanistan’s Journalism 
            Protection Committee’s shelter with hundreds of local Journalists. In due course, she came to the United States 
            as part of an evacuation program through the NGO Sayara. 
          </p>
          <p class="section-text">
            While leaving Kabul, Shirzad was taken to the airport in one of the four minibuses evacuating journalists. 
            As the buses approached closer to the airport, Shirzad could see people spending the night behind the airport gates,
            desperate for even a sliver of an opportunity to enter the airport and get themselves out of the country.
          </p>
          <p class="section-text">
            Shirzad’s eyes were fixated on the window of the bus, but her mind was elsewhere, speeding through the same thoughts 
            over and over again.
          </p>
          <p class="section-text">
            “What will I do where I’m going now? Who is there, who am I facing, how will the environment be? What about my 
            goals and dreams?
          </p>
          <p class="section-text">
            Kabul had collapsed quickly and the window of opportunity to escape, for many, was getting smaller. If Shirzad was 
            going to escape, she had to do it now! When she left for Qatar, she could not inform her family about the runoff. 
            During a connecting flight from Qatar to Italy, she called her elder sister to break the news. In the four months 
            that followed, Shirzad’s mother had still not recovered from her daughter’s absence. Her mental conditions worsened,
            landing her in the hospital. Regardless, there was nothing that could have been done about it.
          </p> 
          <p class="section-text">
            “If I were there, my family's life would be in danger and I would create problems for them. And I would lose one 
            of my family members due to my presence (in Afghanistan),” Shirzad said.

          <p class="section-text">
           As a journalist with Voice of America, Shirzad reported on the narcotics beat. Every time she prepared a story, 
           accusations of being an infidel followed. She received threats from various people who disapproved of her working 
           relationship with Americans. The threats became more intense after the Taliban usurpation. Shirzad was explicitly 
           told when the Badakhshan provin fell, she would be executed. The fear in her heart grew stronger, not just for her own,
           but for her family’s safety. To protect her loved ones, Shirzad had to leave.
          </p>
          <p class="section-text">
           “I just want to meet my mom once, and give her a big hug,” she added.
          </p>
          <p class="section-text">
           Shirzad now lives in Sacramento, California. She is working as a videographer in a production company and at a 
           restaurant packing food orders. She wishes for two things, to resume her journalism career and to go back home.
          </p>
          <p class="section-text">
            Many more journalists like them had to flee their motherland due to the continuing attacks on journalists. According 
            to data collected by the Committee to Protect Journalists, 2,195 journalist executions have been recorded across the 
            globe between 1992-2023. Out of these, 79 are recorded in Afghanistan. “Everything that is happening at the moment 
            paradoxically makes the profession (of journalism) all the more important,” said Anna Brakha, a Europe and Central 
            Asia researcher with CPJ.
          </p>
          <p class="section-text">
            These journalists come from different countries and political contexts but have met the same fate of either 
            execution or exile. Their journeys are a mirror to the brutal truth of the dying press freedom globally.
